    "title": "About Me",
    "p1": "I have always been fascinated by how technology can transform ideas into real solutions that impact people's lives. That passion led me to study Computer Engineering at the University of Seville, a path I am about to complete.",
    "p2": "For me, programming is not just writing code: it is an exercise in creativity, logic, and problem-solving, a way to build useful and purposeful tools.",
    "p3": "After completing my first professional experience at Tier 1 Technology, I find myself at a key moment: I am looking for a new challenge that allows me to continue growing as a developer. I am passionate about backend development with Java and Spring Boot, but what really motivates me is continuous learning, exploring new technologies, and adding value within a team that shares the same vision of innovation."
